# Optimal Lineup Rankings
Script to use Sleeper api to get Potential Points for each team in a sleeper league and rank the teams

I use it to determine draft order in my dynasty league for non-playoff teams (hence line below non-playoff teams)

Changing league_id to your league ID (found in url of sleeper website) in main.py and running script will show order in results.txt
